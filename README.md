# Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Regressio--Stock-Price-Predictionn

1- A dataset for stock price prediction for 5 years with one sample per day is used
(q2_dataset.py). 

2- A Recurrent Neural Network using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used.

3- To predict the next day opening price using the past 3 days Open, High, and
Low prices and volume. Therefore, each sample will have (4*3 = ) 12 features.
